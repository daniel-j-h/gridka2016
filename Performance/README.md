### Performance

Mostly insights into the compiler.

### Tasks

`kahan.cc`

- [ ] Take a look at [Kahan Summation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahan_summation_algorithm)
- [ ] Spin up the [Compiler Explorer](http://gcc.godbolt.org/) and take see what's getting generated
- [ ] Play around with flags such as `-O2`, `-O3`, `-ffast-math` (what's this flag doing? would you recommend it?)

`inliner.cc`

- [ ] Read the docs for Clang's `-Rpass` flag
- [ ] Analyze what the compiler is doing with the code; can you improve it?
