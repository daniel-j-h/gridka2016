### Warmup

Let's see if our environment works.

### Tasks

`compile.cc`

- [x] Fire up your compiler of choice (by which I mean GCC or Clang):

        g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++14 compile.cc

`pointers.cc`

- [x] What kind of issues do you see? Fix them!
- [x] Is there a better way to handle these situations? Refactor!
